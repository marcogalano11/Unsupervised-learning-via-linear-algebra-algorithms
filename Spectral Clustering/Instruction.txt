To run the code the following python libraries are needed: 
-numpy
-pandas
-sklearn
-scipy
-matplotlib

The code is divided in blocks inside the main function; each block is identified by a comment with a # telling what the following block is doing.

The analyses performed are split between functions, and each function is providing a result:
- dataset_analysis prints the number of connected components (from which we decide m);
- eigenvalues analysis computes and plots the m smallest eigenvalues;
- pipeline performs the spectral clustering from k eigenvalues.

The code is initially uncommented and can be run producing the same results in the same order as those indicated in the report. Doing so will result in the code producing several plots, that will have to be sequentially closed to continue with the execution.

However, the original idea behind this division in blocks is to perform each analysis separately and, if needed, changing values in the code. The division in blocks allows to do so by commenting all the unneeded blocks, and performing the analysis only on the relevant one. 
The only blocks that should not be commented are the first three: ACQUISITION OF THE CIRCLE DATASET, ACQUISITION OF THE SPIRAL DATASET, GENERATION OF THE 3D DATASET.

Customizable values:
1) In each block there is an int m, that is the number of smallest eigenvalues that will be computed and plotted.

2) In each block there is a k, that can be a list of values or a single value. It represents the number of clusters that will be computed, and can be customized based on the eigenvalues analysis.

3) The function that generates the random lines in a 3D space has all its parameters customizable:
   - min_ax is the lowest value admitted for each of the axes (negative value);
   - max_ax is the highest value admitted for each of the axes (positive value);
   - n_items is the number of lines that will be generated;
   - points_per_line is the number of points that each line contains;
   - noise is the standard deviation that each point has from the main line.
